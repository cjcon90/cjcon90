# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Ciaran (sounds like 'keearan').

I'm a professionally qualified child protection social worker, with a lifelong interest for technology. In April 2020 I wrote my first HTML `Hello World` and since then I have been self-teaching to try and turn this new found passion into a career! I'm eager to build my network and find new opportunities where I can learn more about the wonderful mix of logic and creativity that is web/software development.
