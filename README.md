A production engineer with a background in child protection social work, and a passion for coding and problem-solving. I'm driven by the opportunity to make a difference and have a positive impact, whether it was working in a people-focused role, or ensuring the smooth operation of critical infrastructure!

Since September 2021, I have worked with the OpenBMC team at Meta, where I have focused on automated testing and deployment of firmware at scale. I am always motivated by the opportunity to take on new challenges, whether it's tackling complex deployment issues or exploring new technologies.

Let's connect and see how we can build great things together :-)
